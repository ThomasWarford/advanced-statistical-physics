## Simulating the [Brusselator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brusselator) System with Numerical Integration and the Gillespie Algorithm
System size is controlled by $\Omega$ and $b$ controls the rate at which X turns into Y.

Note even after a long time the probabilistic simulation doesn't converge. This is because X catalyses its own creation.
